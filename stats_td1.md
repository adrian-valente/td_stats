## First TD
Goals: open and explore a dataset, visualize all kinds of relationships between variables, compute a summary statistic and a confidence interval for it, choose statistical test for categorical data independence.

### Data katas and EDA
* Load and open the Titanic dataset. What does it contain? Describe the columns (especially type of the elements. Btw what are the different existing types in R?). Look at the first 5 rows. How many rows are there?

* Factor columns: it is important to know the number of different values and their counts/distribution. Do that for all the factor columns of the dataset.

* Conversions: Pclass is considered as a number, but it would be convienent to consider it as a factor. Convert and look at the distribution. Same for SibSp.

* Missing values: real data is never as you expect! Which columns contain missing values, and how many of them?

* Contingency (aka pivot) table: how many women/men survived? Can you further decompose the data by class?

* Aggregation/grouping of data: can you plot the survival rate by class and sex (separately, then together)?

* Continuous variables: can you plot the distribution of ages and of fares? Compute the means, standard deviation of medians of these variables?

* Continous/categorical variable relationship: can you plot the age distribution of the groups that survived and that didn't? Same for the fare?

* What about relations between continous/continous variables?

### The trinity of statistics: the estimator, the p-value, and the effect size
* At the core of statistics stands the notion of *model*. We consider that the data that we are given (under the form of *samples* $(\mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_N)$) has been generated by a certain process which:
   - can be described mathematically, 
   -  incorporates randomness, 
   -  and depends on certain parameters 
  
  (formally we say that each $\mathbf{x}_i$ is sampled from a parametrized probability distribution $f(\mathbf{x}; \theta)$). The objective of the statistician can be 3-fold: 
  - to estimate the values of the parameters $\theta$, and estimate the uncertainty of his knowledge (which gives the domain of *estimators* and *confidence intervals*)
  - to confront alternative models between each other (which gives the domain of *statistical tests* to measure *p-values*)
  - to characterize the relevance of each component of his model (with the *effect sizes* associated to tests).
  
* Think of models that could give rise to the Titanic survival rate. Try to formalize them mathematically.

* We will consider the simplest one, that for each passenger a Bernoulli sample is generated to determine its survival. What is the parameters associated to this model? How to estimate it? Can you generate a confidence interval for it? (if you are mathematically oriented, I encourage you to think about how a CI can be computed with the central limit theorem).

* Let us consider a more complex model. We will still consider that for each passenger survival is determined by a Bernoulli sample, but from a sex-dependent distribution. What are the parameters, and can you estimate them? Can you generate confidence intervals? Do the CIs for the 2 parameters overlap?

* We would like to know which model to choose. Usually, a statistican aims for simplicity, and so should choose the second model only if data unvalidates the first one. Formally, this corresponds to saying that by default we will assume data comes from the first model (ie. survival does not depend on sex), which we call the null hypothesis, and confront it to the second one (ie. survival depends on sex) which we call the alternative hypothesis. What statistical test would you choose to confront these hypotheses? Now run it. What effect size to associate to it?

* Is there any influence of age on the survival rate? Which statistical tests can answer to that question?
  
* Unrelated to survival now: we want to model the continuous random variables age and fare. What would be a good probability distribution that could fit them?

* How can you simultaneously test for an effect of all variables on survival?

### A cautionary tale: Simpson's paradox
* In R, load the UCBAdmissions dataset `data(UCBAdmissions)`. Notice it is already under the form of a contingency table.

* Compute the acceptance rate for men and women overall, and then by department. How is this possible?

* The original article is Bickel et al., "Sex bias in graduate admissions: data from Berkeley", 1975
